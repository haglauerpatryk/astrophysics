# astrophysics

This is my project for fun when I try to implement things that I've learned in astrophysics and learn on how to optimize my code.

Currently there are two files:
  - computation_optimalization - to show steps I made from plain math to code and what I did to optimize this.
  - main_project - here is the latest version of this project.

Currently it calculates orbits of 2 Planets around its barycenters of mass, which is way harder than it may seem,
and I lack some resources, because on the internet they cover it only when two bodies are not bending each others spacetimes.
